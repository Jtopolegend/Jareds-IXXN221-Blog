    <h2>Blog Reflections</h2>
    <h2>Why GIT is useful for designers</h2>
    <p>		 I believe Git to be useful for designers today as it allows us to quickly share and post our progress with our
			 code on the site which allows fellow team members involved in a group project  to collaborate effectively as they 
			 will be able to share the progress with team members through the features of branching where users can see each others 
			 code in a way that is accessible for the team to see with the website they are developing and sharing with each other through 
			 it as it is being updated live. Github allows what you want on git to be hosted through a server offering even better
			 Collaboration with other developers  with also the same code at the same time which allows a lot of testing with prototyping 
			 and helping designers find the best solution for problems they are facing through the variety of testing they are doing to 
			 solve this, they will also  be able to keep constantly updating it with git each time the use the commands correctly
			 and constantly and ensuring it is up to date for fellow team members and people with access to see it all as it is being 
			 changed live through Github.</p>

			 <h2> How i made my code accessible </h2>

  		<p>  The first step in ensuring that my code is accessible is to make sure it is working and functioning properly 
	 		 on any webrowser which allows me to test if there are any issues i will need to make fix once this step is done
      		 i can move on to trying to create a respispotary on github that is made public allowing others to view it with
	  		 the link i will provide them to once that is done i can import my code into the respispotary which will then
     	     host my website through the github server for anyone to see and also the files to manipulate and download
	 		 on there own which allow it to be accessible to a wide range of people one thing i can do moving forward
	 		 is to constantly update it when changes are made that will impact the website as a whole in both major and minor ways.
